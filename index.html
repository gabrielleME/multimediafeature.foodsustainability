          We’re all guilty of throwing food away. Those leftovers that never did get finished. Those apples that have lost their crunch. For me it’s the two for one buys that seemed like a good idea at the time but just end up sitting in the fridge, withering past their best before date.
        But the <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/campaigns/food-waste">average household is losing £470</a> by the 7 million tonnes of food that is thrown away each year. Add this to the shocking statistics about food poverty – a <a href="https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/890/">Unicef report</a> found that nearly one in five children in the UK under the age of 15 do not have secure access to enough food- and there is a big problem to digest.

            <p>Compared to other countries, the UK is falling behind. In 2016, France made it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/04/french-law-forbids-food-waste-by-supermarkets">illegal for supermarkets to throw away food that is edible</a> or that could be used for animal feed. A Norwegian based online platform, <a href="http://bestb4.azurewebsites.net/index.cshtml">bestfør.no</a>, allows supermarkets to track products’ sell by dates and alerts charities to food that cannot be sold but that is still safe to eat and has full approval from the government. A <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environment-food-and-rural-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/food-waste-inquiry-16-17/">food waste inquiry</a> was commissioned by the UK government in 2016 but there is yet to be an overall change to legislation.

There is a home-grown food sustainability movement however, thanks to willing volunteers across the country that recognise change is needed. Many cities now have <a href="http://therealjunkfoodproject.org/">cafes</a> that turn edible food that would otherwise be thrown away into wonderful three course meals, with a pay-as-you-feel price tag. Another way food sustainability is being promoted across the UK is through organisations called ‘food co-operatives’, or food co-ops for short.These food co-ops are non-profit enterprises with the aim to save food waste and give affordable food to the community, a solution to both the aforementioned issues. I attended Sustainability Morecambe’s food club in Lancashire to see this food story for myself.

            <p> <b>“The first thing to say is that we are not a food bank,” </b> Jo Ainscough, the Secretary of Sustainability Morecambe. <b> “We’re a food club that reduces social isolation in the community by bringing people together, all whilst saving food from landfill”.</B> </p>

<p>I ask Jo if the food bank label is a problem:<b> “There’s a real stigma attached but in reality all types of people are members of our club, and that’s what we try to promote. We’re not just giving food to people that are short on money, we’re showing people that a lot of food that gets thrown away is of a high quality.”</b> </p>

<p>This particular group was set up at the end of 2016 by a small number of people living in Morecambe that wanted to change the current attitude towards food waste. In their first year they’ve gained over fifty members, had a visit from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn –although the group is clear that it is not apolitical- and have even won a regional award last September.
</p>

<p> </p>
    <p> <b> “It was just great to be shortlisted for the Bay Living Awards, but then to win best Community Focus/ Social Action really made all the hard work we do worthwhile,”</b> explained Linda Smalley, one of the founding members of Sustainability Morecambe. </P>

<p>The food is collected from supermarkets in Preston by <a href="http://fareshare.org.uk/fareshare-centres/lancashire-and-cumbria/">FareShare</a>- a national charity- but volunteers from Sustainability Morecambe pick up the saved food and bring it back to a local church, where the club is held on a weekly basis. The food is then sorted and organised ready for members to arrive. Everyone that attends is a registered member and pays a donation of £2 a week to cover the petrol and any other running costs. </P>

              <p> <b>“If the two pounds is not feasible then that’s fine, we just ask people help us clear away afterwards”</b> Jo adds. Fairness is definitely well practiced here as seen by the orderly fashion in which its members are queuing. Upon arrival, people randomly pick a card with a number on it, determining what order food can be collected. I turn over my card to see the number 18.<b>“Ooh beginner’s luck! 18 out of 60 is not bad at all,” </b> Francis, Treasurer of Sustainability Morecambe and the friendly face greeting everyone, has retired but told me that the club has been a great way for her to be involved in a group she feels passionate about.

<p> On the same table as the donation box, there are two Tesco’s finest whole chickens and five blocks of Wyke Farms cheddar cheese. I am told that these are limited items and so will be placed in a raffle at 50p a ticket with all the money raised going towards refrigerators so larger quantities of food can be stored. The club is nearly at the maximum of 60 members but they are hoping to expand in the future to meet with the growing demand. </p>

<p> Even without the food element, it’s easy to see how the co-op acts benefits the community. The hall is full of chatter, primary school children offering biscuits to the elderly, young parents with babies, teenagers making cups of tea. Everyone is polite, friendly and very complimentary of the group.<p>
            <p>
                <b>“It’s a real shame that all this food would just be thrown away,” </b> said Deborah Skelly who works in a nearby primary school. <b>“Some children come to school hungry because they’ve not had proper meals and when there’s so much good food just going to waste, it’s just absurd” </b>.

            </p>
            <p>
                Looking at the quantity of food placed on the tables, it does seem nuts that it would just be sent to landfill when there’s such vast food insecurity around the country. Another member of the group, Bryan Kelly mentioned that the club has helped him lead a better lifestyle, <b> “I’ve cut down my shopping costs and sometimes there’s things that I would never buy like sweet potatoes. People share recipes so my cooking has improved too.” </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                He’s referring to recipes posted on the Sustainability Morecambe <a href="http://sustainabilitymorecambe.co.uk/recipes/">website</a> which all incorporate the food collected at the co-op in some way. There’s a bit of everything: a nutritious bean and noodle bowl, a warming roast tomato and vegetable sauce as well as some simple oaty biscuits. This definitely the most sustainable approach to food other than growing it yourself.
            </p>

<p>
  I’m very impressed with my final haul: from a good-sized butternut squash, to a bag of leafy spinach, tinned pineapple rings to courgette and onions, there was plenty of scope for me to make a recipe from. Visiting Sustainability Morecambe was a real eye-opener to how wrong the existing attitude towards food is. If we all made a conscientious effort to support such causes, or even made a small commitment to throw away less food, we could very much be on our way to solving the problem at hand- all whilst cooking some delicious food. The future of food stability depends on it.
